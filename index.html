    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>All of my decisions in life have led me to one of my favorite subjects. Computers and software developement. It is an exciting time to be working in the tech industry, and I am excited to jump right in and join all of you!</p>

    <p>
      Outside web development I love the ocean (who'd have guessed!), riding my bike, the great outdoors in general, and learning new things!
